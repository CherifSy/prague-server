We operate a hosted version at takecharge.io. 

The application uses the Stripe API to provide server side account management and API glue to allow people to make donations to organisations that they care about. It also allows organisations to sign up for the donation processing service. 

You can download the GeoIP database we use here:

Be sure to specify `GEOCOUNTRY_LITE_PATH` in your environment somewhere.
